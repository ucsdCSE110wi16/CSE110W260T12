Week 4:
  DONE: Successfully created basic scrollable interface!
Week 5:
  TODO: finish "new post" option (parse). Begin working on activity for when a post opens up.
  DONE: Created lots of the layout. Parse interaction is completely set up. Users can create posts (new post screen opens up), 
  submit, view posts (opened post screen). There is also a temporary clear button that deletes the items off of parse (for 
  testing, will be removed before the finished product). 
Week 6:
  Todo: begin user story 6 (Group functionality + group chat - Kenny/Amit work on this)
        Clean up the menu options for creating a new post (Daylon)
        Increase Parse use (change to sending note class objects instead of strings to parse, automatic deletion? low priority) (Daylon)
        Comment functionality (Yahav)
Week 7:
  User story 10, User story 11
Week 8Â­10:
  Rest of the User stories (low priority, miscellaneous bonus features)
